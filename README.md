# React - Netflix Clone

This is the code repository for a Netflix Clone. It was built to learn React.js and better understand VS Code.

I have not manged to get the trailer system to work as it should and only seems to retrieve certain film trailers when clicked.

The hosted application can be viewed [here](https://video-streaming-77ff5.web.app/).

This application was learnt from Clever Programmer who's video can be found here. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtMThy8QKqU)
